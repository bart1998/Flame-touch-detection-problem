# Flame touch detection

A very simple Flutter application with two screens. The first screen contains a button to go to the second screen. The second screen is a black Flame screen. If the screen is touched it is printed to the console.

## Problem

Touches are not detected properly on the game screen. Some of the taps are recognized. If you tap long enough every tap will get recognized.
